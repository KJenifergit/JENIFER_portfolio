Intro:

	Storing Data on disk (EFS,EBS,EC2 Instance Store,S3)can have its limits
	Sometimes,you want to store data in database.
	You can structure the data
	You build indexes to efficiently query/search through the data
	You define delationship b/w your datasets.


Relational Databases

Amazon RDS 

	RDS-Relational Databases service
	It is managed DB service for DB use SQL as a query language
	It allows you to create databases in the cloud that are managed by AWS
		Postgres
		MySQL
		MAriaDB
		Oracle
		Microsoft SQL server
		IBM DB2
		Aurora(AWS proprietary database)

RDS Solution Architecture

Amazon Aurora:

	Aurora is proprietary technology from AWS(not open sourced)
	PostgreAQL and MySQL are both supported as AuroraDB
	Aurora is "AWS Cloud OPtimized" and claims 5x performance improvement over My SqL on RDS, over 3x the performance of Postgres on RDS
	Aurora storage automatically grows in increments of 10 GB ,up to 128 TB
	Aurora costs more than RDS (20% more)-but is more efficient
	Not in the free tier

Red Shift

	Redshift is based on PostgreSQL ,but its not used for OLTP
	It's OLAP online analytical processing(analytics & data warehousing)
	Load data once every hour,not every second
	10x better performnace than other data warehouses,scale to PBs of data
	Columnar storage of data(instead of row based)
	Massively Parallel Query EXecution (MPP),highly available
	Pay as you go based on the instances provisioned
	Has a SQL interface for performing the queries
	BI tools such as AWS Quicksight to Tableau integrate with it.

RedShift Serverless

	Automatically provisions and scales data warehouse underlying capacity
	Run analytics workloads managing data warehouse infrastructure
	pay only for what you use(save costs)
	use cases:Reporting ,dashboarding appliactions,real time analytics

EMR

	EMR-Elastic MAp Reduce
	EMR-helps creating Hadoop cluster(bigdata) [It means--collection of various commodity 
		hardware where these hardware components work together as a single unit]
	
Amazon Athena

	Serverless query service to perform analytics against S3 objects
	Uses standard SQL language to query the files
	Supports CSV,JSon,ORC,Avro and PArquet(built on Presto)
	use compressed or columnar data for cost-savings

Amazon Quicksight

	Serverless machine learning-powered BI service to create interactive dashboards
	FAst,automatially scalable,embeddable ,withper-session pricing
	Use cases:
		Business analytics
		Building Visualisations
		Perform ad-hoc analysis
		Get business insights using data
	Integrated with RDS,Aurora,Athena,Redshift,S3


Amazon DocumentDB

	Aurora is an "AWS -implementation: of PostgreSQL/MYSQL
	DocumentDB is the same for MangODB (which is NoSQL database)
	MangoDB is used to store ,query,and index JSON data
	similar "deployment concepts "as aurora
	Fully managed ,highly available with replication across 3 AZ
	DocumentDB storage automatically grows in increments of 10GB
	Automatically scales to workloads with millions of requests per seconds.

Amazon Neptune

	Fully managed graph database
	A poular graph dataset would be a social network
		Users have friends
		Posts have comments
		Comments have likes from users
		Users share and like posts.
	Highly available across 3AZ,with upto 15 read replicas
	Build and run applications ,working with highly connected databases
		-Optimised for thes complex and hard queries
	Can store up to billions of relationsand query the graph with milliseconds latency
	Highly available with replications across multiple AZs.
