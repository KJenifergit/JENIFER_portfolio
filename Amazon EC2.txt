Amazon EC2
	EC2---Elastic Cloud Compute
	It is one of the most popular of 'AWS'Offering
	EC2=Elastic Cloud Compute=Infrastructure as a Service
	It mainly consists of capability of
		->Renting Virtual Machines(EC2)
		->Storing data on virtual drives(EBS)
		->Distributing load accross machines(ELB)
		->Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group(ASG)


EC2 Instance types BAsics

	different EC2 instances
		=>General Purpose
		=>Compute Optimized
		=>Memory Optimized
		=>Accelerated Computing
		=>Storage Optimized
		=>HPC Optimized
		=>Instance Features
		=>Measuring Instance Performace

Example: m5.2xlarge   ==>> where m --->Instance class,
				5  --->generation(AWS improves them over time),
				2xlarge  --->size within the instance class.


Security groups:

	->Security groups are the fundamental of network security in AWS
	->THey control how traffic is allowed into or out of our Instances.
	->Security groups only contain allow rules.
	->security groups rules can reference by IP or by security group.
	->Security Groups are acting as a "firewall"on EC2 instances
	->They regulate:
		->Access to ports
		->Authorised Ip ranges---IPv4 and IPv6
		->Control of inbound network(from other to instance)
		->Control of outbound network(from the instance to other)

Rules:
		Inbound rules
		Outbound rules


SSH--Secure Shell------>>command line interface 

	It allows to control the remote machine.


EC2 instances Purchasing Options

	->On-Demand Instances
	->Reserved(1&3 years)
		->REserved instance
		->convertible Reserved instances
	->Savings plan
	->Spot Instances
	->Dedicated Hosts
	->Dedicated Instances
	->Capacity REservations

EC2 Instance Storage :

EBS-----Elastic Block Storage

	-->An EBS (Elastic Block Store )Volume is a network drive you can attach to your instances while they run.
	-->It allows your instances to persist data even after their termination.
	-->They can only be mounted to one instance at a time( at the CPU level)
	-->They are bound to a specific availability zone


EBS Volume

	-->It is a network drive(i.e. not a physical drive)
		It uses the network to communicate the instance which means there might be a bit of latency
		It can be detached from the Ec2 instance and quickly attached  to the another instance
	-->It's locked to an Availability Zone(AZ)
		If it is in one region cannot be attached to another region
		To move a volume accross  first we need to snashot.
	-->Have a provisioned capacity(size in GB's & IOPS)


AMI---Amazon Machine Image
 	-->AMI are a customization of an EC2 Instance
		Where we can add own software ,configuration ,OS,monitoring
		faster boot/configuration time because all your software is pre-packaged
	-->AMI are built for a specific region(and can be copied across regios)
	-->You can lauch EC2 instances from
		A public AMI:AWS provided
		You own AMI:you make & maintain them yourself
		AN AWS Marketplace AMI:an AMI someone else made(and potentially sells)




EFS---Elastic File System

	MAnaged NFS (Network File System)that can be mounted on 100s of EC2  instances in a region
	EFS works with Linux EC2 instances in multi-AZ
	Highly available,scalable,expensive(3x gp2),pay per use,no capacity planning.

 
EFS-IA--Cost optimized storage class for infrequent accessed files

 Amazon FSX----3 rd party high performance file systems on AWS
	   ----Fully managed service
Use cases:

	FSX for Lustre
	FSX for Windows File Server
	FSX for NetApp ONTAP
