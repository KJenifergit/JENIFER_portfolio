ELB-Elastic Load Balancer
	Load balancers are servers that forward internet traffic to multiple servers(EC2Instances)downstream.

Why we are using the load balancers:

	-->Spread load across multiple downstream instances
	-->Expose a single point of Access(DNS) to your application
	--->it will also handle the failures of Downstream instances.
	--->Do regular health checks to your instances
	--->Provide SSL tremination (HTTPS) for your websites. 

4 Kinds of LOad balancers:

	Application Load Balancer(HTTTP/HTTPS only)---layer 7
	Network Load Balancer(ultra high performance,allows for TCP)---layer 4
	Gateway Load Balancer---Layer 3
	Classic Load Balancer(retired in 2023)---layer 4 & 7

Autoscaling GRoup

The goal of AutoScaling Group(ASG) is to 
	Scale out (add EC@ instances)to match an increase load
	Scale in(remore EC2 instances)to match a decrease load
	We have to ensure minimum & maximum number of machines running
	Automatically register new instances to a load balancer
	Replace unhealthy Instances 

AUTo scaling Groups--Scaling strategies

	Manual scaling--update the size of an ASG manually
	Dynamic scaling---respond to changing demand
		=>Simple/Step scaing
			When a cloudwatch alarm is triggered (eg CPU>70% ),then add 2 units
			When a cloudwatch alarm is triggered (example CPU<30%)then remove 1
		=>Target Tracking Scaling
		=>Scheduled Scaling
	Predictive scaling-uses ML to predict the future Traffic ahead of time.
