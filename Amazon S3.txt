Amazon S3
	
	----Simple Storage Service
	----Amazon S3 is an object storage service that stores data as objects within buckets. An object is a file 
		and any metadata that describes the file. A bucket is a container for objects.
	----To store your data in Amazon S3, you first create a bucket and specify a bucket name and AWS Region
	----Each bucket as Object and it is a unique identifier for thwe object within the bucket.
	----use S3 Versioning to keep multiple versions of an object in the same bucket---- allows  to
		restore objects that are accidentally deleted or overwritten
	-----Buckets and Objects in s3 are Private we can able to access only if we have permission.
	----You can use bucket policies, AWS (IAM) policies, ACLs, and S3 Access Points to manage access.

Buckets------A bucket is a container for objects stored in Amazon S3. You can store any number of objects in a
		bucket and can have up to 100 buckets in your account. 

Objects------Objects consist of object data and metadata & The metadata is a set of name-value pairs that describe the object.
		An object is uniquely identified within a bucket by a key (name) and a version ID (if S3 Versioning is enabled on the bucket)


Keys-----An object key (or key name) is the unique identifier for an object within a bucket. Every object in a
		bucket has exactly one key. The combination of a bucket, object key, and optionally, version ID (if
		S3 Versioning is enabled for the bucket) uniquely identify each object.
