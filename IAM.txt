IAM-Identity and Access Management
	---It is a Global service because we are going to create USERS & GROUPS
	---Root account created by default ---shouldn;t be used or shared
	---Users are people within your organisation ,and can be grouped.


IAM--permissions

	---Users or Groups can be assigned JSON documents called POLICIES

IAM Policies Inheritance:

	we havE to create Inline policy if the user is not in the group

IAM policies Structure:

IAM Guideliness & Best Practices

->Don't use the root account except for AWS account setup
->One physical user = one AWS user
->Assign users to groups and assign permissions to groups
->Create a strong password policy
->use an denforce the use of MFA
->Create and use Roles for giving permissions to AWS services
->Use Access keys for programmatic Access(CLI/SDK)
->Audit permissions of your account using IAM credentials Report & IAM Access Advisor.
->NEver ever share IAM users  &  Access Keys.


Shared Responsibility model for IAM

	AWS responsibility:

		Infrastructure (Global network Security)
		Configuration and vulnerability analysis
		Compliance Validation

	Yours Responsibility:

		Users,Groups ,Roles,POlicies management and monitoring.
		Enable MFA on all accounts
		Rotate all your keys often
		Use IAM tools to apply appropriate permissions
