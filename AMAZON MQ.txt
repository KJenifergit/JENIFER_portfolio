Amazon MQ(MESSAGE QUEUES):( suppots Apache ActiveMQ,RabbitMQ) QUEUES---Waiting till their turn to be attenedr proccessed..
	--->it is a managed message broker service(it is software app that enables applications,systems ,services  to communicate with each other
             and exchanging information using various programming languages, OS and protocals)
	---> broker(it act as a third party  vendor who hepls us to achieve our goal)
	---> creating and connecting broker is slightly differ for each broker engine types (Appache activeMQ and RabbitMQ)

Basic elements in MQ:

	1--->Broker  (basic building block)
	          Types    1.(Single-instance( one broker in 1 AZ's & communicate with EFS and EBS volume)) 
			   2.Active /Standby(2 broker in 2 different AZ's and communicate with EFS)
	2---> Configuration---contains all setting in XML format
                           ---A configuration can be applied to one or more brokers
	3----->Users and groups--->user is aperson/appliacation that access queues and topics and group is a semantic level)
	4-----> storage----> suppors EBS and EFS
                       ---->By default ,Active MQ brokers use EFS for broker Storage
			---> use EBS for m5(size) broken instance type 


How amazonMQ works: [benefits-you can migrate applications and messagages without rewriting code,  reduce costs(pay only for broker usage and storage)]
	-->MQ broker can use any type
	-->you can access brokers using various programming languages that  ActiveMQ supports and can use common protocals and messaging Apis.
